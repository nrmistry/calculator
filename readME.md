CALCULATOR PROJECT

This is a functioning calculator using typescript, html and scss. Deployed on git pages. 

It can do basic math functions such as: +, -, / and * and has a functioning AC button. It can also chain sums so you don't have to remember the answer from before. This is my first time using typescript! I hope you enjoy!
